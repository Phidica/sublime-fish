  argument:
    patterns:
    - name: meta.function-call.arguments.fish
      comment: An argument is one of the fundamental units, however we define it by the very essence of not being any of the other fundamental units '#', '\', and the control operators (';', '&', and '|'). All those have special treatment when they appear in command-calls, so we attend to them uniquely
      begin: (?<=^|\s)(?!\s|#|$|\\$)
      comment: Begin arg at the boundary between whitespace (or beginline for when command-call escapes its endline) and anything but whitespace, a comment character (because a lone # can't be an arg), an endline (to prevent blank lines being called args), or an escaped endline (because command-call can spot a lone \ and match it)
      comment: Known bug - ` echo \ #` is supposed to print " #" because the whitespace is forced to become a character and then the # isn't considered lone because forced whitespace precedes it. So "\ #" should be one arg
      end: (?<=\S)(?=\s|\)|;|&|\||$)
      comment: End arg if it precedes unescaped control operators. Everything else is fair game, and strings and variables are matched and properly highlighted if found
      patterns:
      # - include: '#constant' #! \todo This will be things like lone numbers and escape characters, even though fish doesn't treat numbers any differently
      - include: '#string'
      - include: '#variable'
      - include: '#command-substitution'

  command-call:
    patterns:
    - name: meta.function-call.fish
      comment: First check if command-call uses one of the builtins that can specifically take other command-calls as a sole argument. Because some of these builtins can instead take switches, or be backgrounded/piped (in which case they should be considered user commands), look ahead to ensure that no switches or bg/pipe control operators are found
      begin: \b((builtin|command|exec)|(and|not|or))\s+(?!\s|-|&|\|)
      beginCaptures:
        '2': {name: support.function.builtin.fish}
        '3': {name: keyword.control.fish}
      end: (?=\)|;)|(?<!\\)(?=\n)|(?<=&|\|)
      comment: Builtin command-call ends before ')', ';', or an unescaped endline (user command-call will catch the endline), and just after '&' or '|'
      patterns:
      - include: '#command-call'
      - name: constant.character.escape
        match: \\(?=\n)
        comment: command-call may contain an endline if it is escaped; no need to consume the endline (I may be wrong, switch back to \\\n if problems arise)

    - name: meta.function-call.fish
      comment: If the above match for builtin commands failed, try and match user commands
      begin: \b([\w][\w-]*)\b
      beginCaptures:
        '1': {name: support.function.user.fish}
      end: (?=\)|;)|\n|(&|\|)
      endCaptures:
        '1': {name: keyword.control.fish}
      comment: command-call ends before ')' or ';', and at an endline, '&', or '|'. Those last two control operators must be part of a command, so consume them here
      patterns:
      - include: '#argument'
      - include: '#comment'
      - include: '#comment-inline'
      - name: constant.character.escape
        match: \\\n
        comment: command-call may contain an endline if it is escaped; consume the endline to prevent the command-call ending

  command-substitution:
    patterns:
    - name: meta.command-substitution.fish
      comment: If an unescaped endline is encountered within a command-substitution, a command-call ends and on the next line a new one may begin
      begin: \(
      beginCaptures:
        '0': {name: constant.character.command-substitution.fish}
      end: \)
      endCaptures:
        '0': {name: constant.character.command-substitution.fish}
      patterns:
      - include: '#command-call'
      - include: '#comment'
      - include: '#control-operator'
      - name: constant.character.escape
        match: \\(?=\n)
        comment: This match should only be needed for escaped endlines which are not part of any command-call, like if they precede the first command in the substitution. No need to consume the endline

  comment:
    patterns:
    - name: comment.line.number-sign.fish
      comment: Consumes an entire line or the remainder of a line after a control operator, including the endline, thus hiding the entire comment from whatever scope we're in
      match: (?<=^|;|&|\|)\s*(#).*$\n?
      captures:
        '1': {name: punctuation.definition.comment.fish}

  comment-inline:
    patterns:
    - name: comment.inline.number-sign.fish
      comment: Separate from comment as this is only valid inside of command-call. Does not consume the endline, thus allowing command-call to capture it and end. Note that a comment-inline won't start if escaped whitespace precedes the '#'
      match: (?<=[^\\]\s)(#).*$
      captures:
        '1': {name: punctuation.definition.comment.fish}

  control-operator:
    patterns:
    - name: keyword.control.fish
      match: ;
      comment: This is the only operator which is allowed to exist alone on a line. The other control operators are '&' and '|' however they must be preceded by a command, so command-call matches those
    - name: invalid.illegal.control.fish
      match: (^|(?<!\())\s*(&|\|).*$\n?
      comment: These two control operators, '&' and '|', must be preceded by a command, so command-call matches them when they are valid. If they are found in the global scope or first inside a command-substitution, that means they are dangling
