- include: '#comment'
- include: '#line-continuation'

# Style guide:
# - keyword.control.conditional is applied to all control keywords that are actually words (if, else, end, function, etc.)
# - support.function is applied to any fish builtins that we have to treat uniquely, however variable.function is used for everything else including other shell builtins
# - constant.character.escape is used for the backslash at the end of a line which causes line continuation because technically that backslash is "escaping" the literal newline which appears in the unquoted string environment which the shell assumes you are in. In this sense, the backslash is indeed an escape character
# - constant.character.escape is used for \x?? and \0?? escape codes rather than constant.numeric.{hex,octal} because even though the user inputs a numeric value in hex or octal, the codes serve the purpose of making characters not numbers
# - Individual arguments in function calls do not get the variable.parameter label because that swiftly becomes the overwhelming majority of all words in a program
# - By analogy to the recommendation that `meta.function.php meta.function.parameters.php` should never occur, we use a single `meta.function-call` scope and name the argument scope `meta.argument` not `meta.function-call.argument`. Furthermore, a single `meta.function-call` scope continues from the first command name until the consumption of a ';', '&', or '\n'. The same scope continues through '|' because we have no other way to ensure that a command follows a '|'

# To-do list:
#! - Bugfix: Keywords that only work in loops or functions (eg, "continue", "return", etc) will be treated like standard commands if they are located within if-statements within those outer valid blocks. Without a scope stack, we'll have to treat them as always being keywords rather than trying to parse them for the user
#!   A solution would be to have a second if-block which is the same as the first, but named if-loop-block and which also includes the #loop-control-command rule. Ah, but then the $self which it includes would mean that an if inside /that/ if would be a non-loop if block again, unless the if-loop-block is also explicitly included above the $self. I think this would work all the way down? It gets very complicated if anything besides an if is wanted, but I don't see any use case for a loop control command keyword without an if statement
#! - Bugfix: If a command-call line ends in "end" then a comment following it on the line will not be of the insert type, causing the next line of text to be considered arguments
#!   Fixing may require a rethink of the two comment contexts and finding a way to merge them (the key difference is whether the newline is consumed and command-call either terminates or perpetuates based on that)
#!   Better fix?: Newlines are consumed at the end of command calls, so create a pattern in the block group which begins just after the word 'end' when it has no newline after it, and ends at the next newline. everything in between can be any group that's valid (pipes, backgrounding, redirection). this would perhaps get us out of the special piped function group described below
#! - Add comment-inline to the recursive command-call. no point adding comment because recursive will /always/ have ended by the time a full line comment shows up
#! - A special match in the standard command call which is the `[ ]` form of test
#! - Don't forget the special 2>| redirection-into-pipe syntax, which should be handled in the piping syntax

  argument:
    patterns:
    - name: meta.argument.fish
      comment: An argument is one of the fundamental units, however we define it by the very essence of not being any of the other fundamental units '#' and the control operators (';', '&', and '|'). All those have special treatment when they appear in command-calls, so we attend to them uniquely
      begin: (?<=^|\s)(?!\s|#|$)
      comment: Begin arg at a boundary. Before the boundary must be the begin of line (for when a command-call spans multiple lines) or whitespace. After the boundary may be anything but whitespace, a comment character, or a newline (to prevent blank lines being called args)
      end: (?<=.|\n)(?=\s|\)|[;&|<>]|$)
      comment: End arg if it precedes whitespace, unescaped control operators, or a newline. Note fish quirk; the stderr redirection operator '^' does not terminate an arg
      patterns:
      - include: '#string'
        comment: Arguments are made of strings, either quoted or unquoted. The unquoted string rule handles numerics, character escapes, command substitutions, and brace/variable/process expansions

      comment: In fish, commands can be called using any arbitrary combination of quoted and unquoted strings (with a modified set of characters that need to be escaped, pointless escapes expanded into two literal characters, the literal newline allowed if escaped provided it's not the sole character, the comment character allowed if it's not at the front, etc), so we must manually repeat all the definitions of single-quoted, double-quoted, and unquoted strings. Unfortunately, only a single instance of a non-zero `beginCapture` match can be assigned a scope, so it isn't possible to account for the fact that an arbitrary number of strings can be in the command name and give them all the appropriate string scopes. Furthermore, a `begin` match cannot check across multiple lines, so even though line breaks are permitted inside of double-quoted strings we cannot see to the next line and determine that such a command name would be valid
      comment: If this were a *.sublime-syntax then the aformentioned problems could be avoided. We could push the `meta.function-call.standard.fish` and `variable.function.fish` scopes onto the stack simultaneously, then use individual pattern matching on each type of string we find, and finally pop the `variable.function.fish` scope when unescaped whitespace is encountered (hence marking the end of the command name in the command call)
