# Strings used for the "problem" field in popups.
# Each value used for the "change" in the "issues" list must appear here
changes:
  # When a structure won't work until a later version
  added: Added in fish {}
  # When a structure won't behave the way the syntax highlighting shows until a later version
  behaviour: Behaviour changed in fish {}
  # When a structure was marked for removal
  deprecated: Deprecated in fish {}
  # When a structure was removed or intentionally broken
  removed: Removed in fish {}

# For now I'm only specifying version numbers to two fields (eg "3.0"), under
#   the assumption that patch releases (the third field) will never make
#   major changes. But, if that ever happens, the compatibility highlighter ought
#   to have no problem with it because internally I am always padding out the
#   version number to three fields with extra zeroes anyway

# List of conflicting structures between fish versions.
# Each issue must have one or more scope selectors ("selector") used to pick
#   candidate structures from the source file. The full text of each
#   structure (or the text captured after extending the range of the selector
#   by the positive integer "extend" number of characters in both directions)
#   is then tested against the given regular expression ("match").
#   Alternatively, if the expression is "true" then no testing is done
#   and the candidate is immediately accepted. (This is much more
#   efficient when possible, because essentially the regex matching is done
#   during syntax parsing and optimised by Sublime Text.)
#   If the candidate is accepted, then the fish version being
#   targeted by the plugin is compared to each individual state
#   throughout the "history" of the issue. If a conflict is determined
#   (eg, the plugin is targeting fish 2.7 but the issue history indicates
#   the structure was only added in fish 3.0) then the full extent of the
#   structure will be highlighted. Hovering over the region will reveal
#   the "hint" that suggests alternative structures to resolve the conflict
# Important to note: the order of issues is important, as it determines
#   which issue will be preferentially drawn in the (uncommon) event that two
#   or more issues can all describe the exact same region in a file
